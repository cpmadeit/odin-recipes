        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pozole can be prepared in many ways, but all variations include a base of cooked hominy in broth. 
            Typically pork, or sometimes chicken, is included in the base. Vegetarian recipes substitute beans for the meat.
            The three main types of pozole are blanco (white), verde (green) and rojo (red). 
            White pozole is the preparation without any additional green or red sauce. 
            Green pozole adds a rich sauce based on green ingredients, possibly including tomatillos, epazote, cilantro, jalape√±os, or pepitas. 
            Red pozole is made without the green sauce, instead adding a red sauce made from one or more chiles, such as guajillo, piquin, or ancho.</p>
        <p>Pozole (Spanish pronunciation: [po'sole]; from Nahuatl languages: pozoll , meaning cacahuazintle, a variety of corn or maize) is a traditional 
            soup or stew from Mexican cuisine. It is made from hominy with meat (typically pork, but possibly chicken), 
            and can be seasoned and garnished with shredded lettuce or cabbage, chile peppers, onion, garlic, radishes, avocado, salsa or limes. 
            Known in Mesoamerica since the pre-Columbian era, today the stew is common across Mexico and neighboring countries, and is served both as a day-to-day meal 
            and as a festive dish.</p>
