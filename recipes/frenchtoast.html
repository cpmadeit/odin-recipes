        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>French Toast is  a dish made of slices bread soaked in beaten eggs and milk and then pan fried. When served as a sweet dish, milk, sugar, vanilla and/or cinnamon are commonly added before pan-frying. It is usually topped with any combination of sugar (often powdered), butter, fruit, or syrup. May also be served as a savory dish.</p>
        <p>The earliest known reference to French toast is in the Apicius, a collection of Latin recipes dating to the 1st century CE, where it is described as simply aliter dulcia ("another sweet dish"). The recipe says to "Break [slice] fine white bread, crust removed, into rather large pieces which soak in milk [and beaten eggs] fry in oil, cover with honey and serve".
        <p>A 14th-century German recipe uses the name Arme Ritter ("poor knight"), a name also used in English and the Nordic languages. Also in the 14th-century, Taillevent presented a recipe for "tostées dorées".</p>
        <p>Italian 15th-century culinary expert Martino da Como offers a recipe.</p>
        <p>The usual French name is pain perdu, "lost bread", reflecting its use of stale or otherwise "lost" bread — which gave birth to the metaphoric term pain perdu for sunk costs. It may also be called pain doré, "golden bread", in Canada. There are fifteenth-century English recipes for pain perdu.</p>
        <p>An Austrian and Bavarian term is pafese or pofese, from zuppa pavese, referring to Pavia, Italy. The word "soup" in the dish's name refers to bread soaked in a liquid, a sop. In Hungary, it is commonly called bundáskenyér (lit. "coated bread").</p>

            <li>1 (1-pound) loaf of challah bread, cut into 1-inch thick slices (10-12 slices)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of milk, heavycream, or a combination of the two</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp maple syurp, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspon salt</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 300 degrees F</li>
            <li>
                <p>fit a wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet - place the bread in a single layer on the rack</p>
                <p>bake, flipping halfway through, until dry to the touch on both sides, about 15 minutes total</p>
                <p>remove from oven and let cool 5 minutes - meanwhile, make the custard</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>place the milk or cream, eggs, maple syrup, vanilla, and cinnamon in a quart-sized liquid measuring cup</p>
                <p>whisk until fully combined - no streaks of egg remianing</p>
                <p>pour into a 9x13 baking dish</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>add as many slices of challah as can fit in a single layer</p>
                <p>soak, flipping once, until drenched, but not falling apart, 1-2 minutes per side</p>
                <p>return to wire rack, letting excess drip off onto baking sheet, and repeat with remaining challah slices</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>melt 2 tbsp of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat</p>
                <p>when the foaming subsides and the butter is sizzling but not brown, add 4 soaked challah slices</p>
                <p>cook until the bottoms are golden-brown and crispy, 3 - 4 minutes</p>
                <p>flip and cook until the second side is browned, about 3 minutes more</p>
                <p>add remaining 1 tbsp butter to the pan in between batches, swirling as it melts to ensure it doesn't burn</p>
                <p>serve warm with more maple syrup</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>storage:</p>
                <p>leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days</p>
            </li>
