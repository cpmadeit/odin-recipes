        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Meringue Cookies are a light, fluffy, crunchy cookie made by whipping egg whites with a few simple ingredients. They are baked at a low temp for over an hour to achieve their unique crispy texture.</p>
        <p>It has been claimed that meringue was invented in the Swiss village of Meiringen and improved by an Italian chef named Gasparini between the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century. However, this claim is contested; the Oxford English Dictionary states that the French word is of unknown origin.</p>
        <p>The name meringue for this confection first appeared in print in François Massialot's cookbook of 1692. The word meringue first appeared in English in 1706 in a translation of Massialot's book. 
        <p>The first documented recipes recognizable as meringues are found in two considerably earlier seventeenth-century English manuscript books of recipes which give instructions for confections called "white biskit bread" in the book of recipes written in 1604 by Elinor Fettiplace (c.1570 – c.1647) of Gloucestershire and called "pets" in the manuscript of collected recipes written by Lady Rachel Fane (1612/13–1680) of Knole, Kent. Slowly baked meringues are still referred to as "pets" in the Loire region of France due to their light and fluffy texture.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg whites - at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1 cup super fine sugar - can substitute granulated</li>
            <li>pinch os salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>gel food coloring</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>preheat oven to 200 degrees F</p>
                <p>place the room temperature egg whites in the clean bowl of a stand mixer with whisk attachment</p>
                <p>it is important that your bowl is very clean as any bit of fat can inhibit the whipping of the egg whites</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>turn the mixer to medium speed and beat until the egg whites are foamy</p>
                <p>turn the mixer off, add the cream of tartar</p>
                <p>beat again on medium until the whites have turned an opaque white color and just start to hold soft peaks</p>
                <p>starting adding the sugar a few spoonfuls at a time with the mixer running</p>
                <p>adding the sugar slowly helps it incorporate and prevents the meringue from becoming grainy</p>
                <p>continue to add the sugar very gradually - once all sugar is added, add the pinch of salt</p>
                <p>beat whites until they are thick, glossy, and a shiny white color - the whites should have a very stiff peak</p>
                <p>this should take 5-10 minutes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>stop the mixer and add vanilla extract - mix briefly</p>
                <p>if you want one color, add a small amount of coloring and fold in with a spatula, stirring gently</p>
                <p>if you want multiple colors, divide and work quickly to color each batch</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>cover two baking sheets with parchment</p>
                <p>scoop mixture into a piping bag fitted with a large tip - star or round work well</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>pipe meringues onto baking sheets, about 1-1 1/2 inches wide - spread will be minimal, so they can be close together</p>
                <p>bake at 200 F for 1 hour - then turn oven off and allow to cool completely in the oven</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
